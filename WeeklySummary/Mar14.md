 ### My work of this week:

1. wrote a draft version of section of the related work of our project, and add it to the "tex" file, but yet to add references to the "ref.bib".

2. learned the basic architecture of VGG, Resnet, faster-RCNN, but didn't research the details of implementation of each layer of fast-RCNN.

3. looked deeper into the code of process-clipping.py of the project "ui-widgets"
