 ### My work of this week:

1. wrote a draft version of section of the related work of our project.

2. learned the basic architecture of VGG, Resnet, faster-RCNN, but didn't research the details of implementation of each layer of fast-RCNN.

3. looked deeper into the code of process-clipping.py of the project "ui-widgets"
